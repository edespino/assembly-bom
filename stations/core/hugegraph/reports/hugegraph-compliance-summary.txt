Apache HugeGraph 1.7.0 Compliance Validation Summary
=====================================================
Date: 2025-11-20
Validator: Apache Compliance Automation (assembly-bom)

OVERALL RESULT: ❌ FAILED - Multiple Critical Issues

=====================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED
=====================================================

ISSUE #1: Missing RC Designation in Release URL
------------------------------------------------
Severity: CRITICAL - Release Process Violation

Current URL:
  https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hugegraph/1.7.0

Expected URL:
  https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hugegraph/1.7.0-rc1

Problem:
- Release candidates MUST be identified as RC1, RC2, etc.
- Current URL appears to be a final release, not a candidate
- Impossible to distinguish between multiple iterations
- Violates Apache staging conventions

Impact:
- Users cannot identify which candidate is being voted on
- If multiple RCs are needed, no way to version them
- Breaks established Apache release management practices

Reference:
- Apache Release Guide: https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html


ISSUE #2: Multiple Source Tarballs in Single Release
-----------------------------------------------------
Severity: CRITICAL - Release Policy Violation

Found 4 source tarballs:
  1. apache-hugegraph-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
  2. apache-hugegraph-ai-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
  3. apache-hugegraph-computer-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
  4. apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz

Problem:
- Apache releases are defined by repository, not umbrella project
- Each repository requires a separate vote
- Bundling violates release independence
- Users cannot verify which repository produced each tarball

Required Approach:
Create 4 separate release votes:
  [VOTE] Release Apache HugeGraph Core 1.7.0-incubating (RC1)
  [VOTE] Release Apache HugeGraph AI 1.7.0-incubating (RC1)
  [VOTE] Release Apache HugeGraph Computer 1.7.0-incubating (RC1)
  [VOTE] Release Apache HugeGraph Toolchain 1.7.0-incubating (RC1)

ISSUE #3: Built Artifacts Missing 'incubating' in Filenames
------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: CRITICAL - Incubator Policy Violation

Build Validation Results:
- Total artifacts checked: 60
  • JAR files: 58 (from 3 Maven projects)
  • Python wheels: 1
  • Python source distributions: 1
- Compliant: 1 (1.7%)
- Non-compliant: 59 (98.3%)

Problem:
- Almost all built artifacts use version "1.7.0" instead of "1.7.0-incubating"
- Apache Incubator policy REQUIRES "incubating" in all artifact names

Maven/JAR violations (57 out of 58):
  From apache-hugegraph-incubating (39 JARs):
    - hugegraph-core-1.7.0.jar (should be: hugegraph-core-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    - hg-pd-client-1.7.0.jar (should be: hg-pd-client-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    ... (37 more violations)

  From apache-hugegraph-toolchain (10 JARs):
    - hugegraph-loader-1.7.0.jar (should be: hugegraph-loader-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    - hugegraph-hubble-1.7.0.jar (should be: hugegraph-hubble-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    ... (8 more violations)

  From apache-hugegraph-computer/computer (9 JARs):
    - computer-algorithm-1.7.0.jar (should be: computer-algorithm-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    - computer-api-1.7.0.jar (should be: computer-api-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    - computer-core-1.7.0.jar (should be: computer-core-1.7.0-incubating.jar)
    ... (6 more violations)

Python violations (2 out of 2):
  - hugegraph_ai-1.7.0-py3-none-any.whl (should be: hugegraph_ai-1.7.0.incubating-py3-none-any.whl)
  - hugegraph_ai-1.7.0.tar.gz (should be: hugegraph_ai-1.7.0.incubating.tar.gz)

Root Cause:
- Maven POM files use `<version>1.7.0</version>` instead of `<version>1.7.0-incubating</version>`
  • apache-hugegraph-incubating/pom.xml (affects 39 JARs)
  • apache-hugegraph-toolchain/pom.xml (affects 10 JARs)
  • apache-hugegraph-computer/computer/pom.xml uses `<revision>1.7.0</revision>` (affects 9 JARs)
- Python pyproject.toml uses `version = "1.7.0"` instead of `version = "1.7.0.incubating"`
- Version not consistently propagated through all modules

Only 1 Compliant Artifact Found:
  ✓ apache-hugegraph-loader-incubating-1.7.0-shaded.jar (correct naming)

Required Fix:
Maven projects:
1. Update root POM version to "1.7.0-incubating"
2. Ensure all module POMs inherit the incubating version
3. Rebuild: mvn clean install -DskipTests

Python project:
1. Update pyproject.toml version to "1.7.0.incubating"
2. Rebuild: python3 -m build

=====================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
=====================================================

1. IMMEDIATE: Cancel or postpone current vote

2. RESTRUCTURE: Create separate release processes:
   - Split into 4 independent repository releases
   - Each with its own RC directory (e.g., 1.7.0-rc1)
   - Each with separate vote thread

3. RELEASE STAGING: Fix RC designation:
   - Move artifacts from /1.7.0/ to /1.7.0-rc1/
   - Update vote thread with correct RC URL
   - Clearly identify this as RC1

4. VOTE PROCESS: Initiate proper voting:
   - Send separate [VOTE] emails for each repository
   - Each vote references only ONE source tarball
   - Follow standard Apache release vote template

5. FUTURE RELEASES: Establish proper process:
   - Each repository has independent release cycle
   - Always use RC designation in staging URLs
   - Consider staggered releases if dependencies exist


=====================================================
VOTE RECOMMENDATION
=====================================================

-1 (binding/non-binding as appropriate)

This release cannot be approved due to THREE CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. Missing RC designation in release URL
   - URL is /1.7.0/ instead of /1.7.0-rc1/
   - Violates Apache staging conventions

2. Multiple repositories bundled in single vote
   - 4 source tarballs in one release
   - Violates Apache release independence policy

3. Built artifacts missing 'incubating' in filenames
   - 50 out of 51 artifacts incorrectly named (98% non-compliant)
   - Violations across multiple languages:
     • Maven/Java: 48 out of 49 JAR files
     • Python: 2 out of 2 artifacts (wheel + source distribution)
   - Violates Apache Incubator naming requirements
   - Examples:
     • hugegraph-core-1.7.0.jar → should be hugegraph-core-1.7.0-incubating.jar
     • hugegraph_ai-1.7.0-py3-none-any.whl → should be hugegraph_ai-1.7.0.incubating-py3-none-any.whl

All three issues are fundamental Apache policy violations that MUST be
corrected before a valid vote can proceed. The release requires complete
restructuring and rebuilding.
