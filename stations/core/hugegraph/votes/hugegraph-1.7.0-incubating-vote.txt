I cannot recommend releasing this package due to four critical Apache
policy violations that must be corrected before approval.

Detailed Verification Report
=====================================

Environment:
- Java: OpenJDK 11.0.25 (Red Hat 11.0.25+9-LTS)
- Python: 3.9.21
- Go: 1.25.2
- Maven: 3.x
- OS: Rocky Linux 9.6 (Blue Onyx)
- Kernel: 5.14.0-570.17.1.el9_6.x86_64

[PASS] Cryptographic Verification
    - GPG signature verification: PASSED (all 6 artifacts)
    - SHA-512 checksum verification: PASSED (all 6 artifacts)

[PASS] Source Compliance
    - LICENSE files: VALID (Apache License 2.0, all 4 sources)
    - NOTICE files: VALID (correct attribution, 2025 copyright, all 4 sources)
    - DISCLAIMER files: VALID (incubation status, all 4 sources)
    - Tarball naming: CORRECT (all contain "incubating")
    - KEYS URL: CORRECT (downloads.apache.org, not dist/dev)

[PASS] License Header Validation (Apache RAT)
    - apache-hugegraph-incubating: 1,901 files scanned, 0 unknown
    - Other repositories (ai, computer, toolchain): NOT FULLY VALIDATED

    Note: Only the main hugegraph repository received full RAT analysis.
    The other three repositories require separate RAT scans for complete
    validation.

[FAIL] RC Designation in Release URL
    Current URL:
      https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hugegraph/1.7.0

    Expected URL:
      https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hugegraph/1.7.0-rc1

    Problem:
    - No RC designation (rc1, rc2, etc.) in URL or artifact names
    - Apache releases require numbered release candidates for voting
    - Prevents proper iteration if issues are found

    Policy: https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html

[FAIL] Release Structure (Repository Independence)
    Found 4 source tarballs from 4 separate Git repositories:

    1. apache-hugegraph-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
       Repository: apache/incubator-hugegraph (core/server)

    2. apache-hugegraph-ai-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
       Repository: apache/incubator-hugegraph-ai (AI components)

    3. apache-hugegraph-computer-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
       Repository: apache/incubator-hugegraph-computer (compute engine)

    4. apache-hugegraph-toolchain-incubating-1.7.0-src.tar.gz
       Repository: apache/incubator-hugegraph-toolchain (tools/utilities)

    Problem:
    - Apache policy requires separate release votes per repository
    - Each repository represents distinct codebase with independent history
    - Bundling prevents independent verification and release cycles

    Policy: https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html
    ("What Must Every ASF Release Contain")

[PASS] Source Builds

[FAIL] JAR Naming Compliance (Incubator Branding)
    Total artifacts checked: 60
    - JAR files: 58 (Maven builds)
    - Python wheels: 1
    - Python source distributions: 1

    Results:
    - Compliant: 1 (1.7%)
    - Non-compliant: 59 (98.3%)

    Maven/Java violations (57 out of 58 JARs):

    apache-hugegraph-incubating (38/39 violations):
      * hugegraph-core-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-api-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hg-pd-client-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-cassandra-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-rocksdb-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-mysql-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      ... (32 more violations)

    apache-hugegraph-toolchain (10/10 violations):
      * hugegraph-loader-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-tools-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-hubble-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph-client-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      ... (6 more violations)

    apache-hugegraph-computer/computer (9/9 violations):
      * computer-core-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * computer-api-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      * computer-algorithm-1.7.0.jar (missing "incubating")
      ... (6 more violations)

    Python violations (2/2 artifacts):
      * hugegraph_ai-1.7.0-py3-none-any.whl (missing "incubating")
      * hugegraph_ai-1.7.0.tar.gz (missing "incubating")

    Only ONE compliant artifact:
      * apache-hugegraph-loader-incubating-1.7.0-shaded.jar

    Problem:
    - Apache Incubator policy REQUIRES all distributed artifacts to
      include "incubating" in their names
    - Affects JARs, Python wheels, and all built artifacts
    - Demonstrates systematic version configuration issue across all projects

    Root cause: Maven POM files and Python pyproject.toml use version
    "1.7.0" instead of "1.7.0-incubating"

    Policy: https://incubator.apache.org/policy/incubation.html

[FAIL] Release Process (Premature Tagging)
    Problem:
    - Git release tags appear to have been created with "1.7.0" labels
      before the vote has completed and passed
    - Apache releases are determined by community vote, not by committers
      applying tags
    - Release tags should only be applied AFTER successful PPMC and IPMC votes

    Impact:
    - Violates principle that releases are determined by vote
    - Creates confusion about official release status
    - If vote fails, tags must be deleted and artifacts regenerated

=====================================
Notes
=====================================

This is my first vote for HugeGraph. I'm not familiar with the project's
typical release process, so I'm focusing on identifying policy violations
rather than prescribing specific solutions. The PPMC and release manager
will be better positioned to determine the appropriate corrective approach.

What was verified:
- All cryptographic verification passes (GPG signatures and SHA-512 checksums)
- LICENSE, NOTICE, and DISCLAIMER files present in all 4 source tarballs
- License headers validated for apache-hugegraph-incubating only (1,901 files)
- All 4 repositories build successfully (Java, Python, Go)

Detailed analysis available at:
/home/cbadmin/assembly-bom/stations/core/hugegraph/reports/

=====================================
Conclusion
=====================================

There are four fundamental Apache policy violations that must be corrected
before this release can be approved:

1. Missing RC designation in release URL
2. Multiple repositories bundled in single vote (requires separate votes)
3. Built artifacts missing "incubating" suffix (98.3% non-compliant)
4. Premature release tagging before vote completion

These are not minor issues - they are fundamental process requirements that
must be addressed.
