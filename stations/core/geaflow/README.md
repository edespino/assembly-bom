# Apache GeaFlow Component Scripts and Documentation

This directory contains component-specific scripts and validation reports for Apache GeaFlow (Incubator project).

## Component Scripts

### `build.sh`
GeaFlow-specific build script that executes the custom build command:
```bash
./build.sh --module=geaflow --output=package
```

**Usage:**
```bash
./assemble.sh -b apache-bom.yaml -c geaflow --run --steps build
```

**Features:**
- Runs Maven reactor build for all 103 modules
- Captures build output to `/tmp/geaflow-build.log`
- Tracks build duration
- Analyzes build artifacts
- Generates `build-summary.txt` in source directory

**Expected Duration:** 10-20 minutes for full build

---

### `test.sh`
GeaFlow-specific test script that runs the GQL loop detection demo:
```bash
./bin/gql_submit.sh --gql geaflow/geaflow-examples/gql/loop_detection_file_demo.sql
```

**Usage:**
```bash
./assemble.sh -b apache-bom.yaml -c geaflow --run --steps test
```

**Features:**
- Validates GeaFlow runtime functionality
- Tests GQL query engine
- Runs loop detection graph algorithm
- Captures test output to `/tmp/geaflow-gql-test.log`
- Generates `test-summary.txt` in source directory
- Analyzes GeaFlow logs at `/tmp/geaflow/logs/local.log`

**Expected Duration:** 5-10 seconds for test execution
**Note:** GeaFlow process may need manual termination (doesn't auto-exit)
