==================================================

Vote: -1 (binding)


CRITICAL ISSUES
===============

1. Missing Required Files
--------------------------
- NOTICE file: MISSING (required per Apache policy)
- DISCLAIMER file: MISSING (required for incubator releases)

  Reference: https://incubator.apache.org/policy/incubation.html


2. Incubator Naming Violations
-------------------------------
Per the Incubator Release Checklist:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/Incubator+Release+Checklist

- Artifact naming: apache-geaflow-0.7.0-src.tar.gz
  MUST be: apache-geaflow-0.7.0-incubating-src.tar.gz

- Directory naming: apache-geaflow-0.7.0-src/
  MUST be: apache-geaflow-0.7.0-incubating-src/


3. License Header Compliance
-----------------------------
Apache RAT identified 194 files without Apache license headers, including:
- Documentation files (.md, .rst)
- Frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS)
- Configuration files (.yaml, .proto)

RAT report can be reproduced with: mvn apache-rat:check


VERIFIED SUCCESSFULLY
=====================

[X] GPG signatures valid (all 2 artifacts)
[X] SHA512 checksums valid (all 2 artifacts)
[X] LICENSE file present (Apache License 2.0)
[X] Source builds successfully (10-20 min build time)

RECOMMENDATION
==============

The release must be rejected due to 4 critical Apache Incubator policy
violations. While the source code quality is verified (builds and runs
correctly), the release artifacts do not meet incubator requirements.

The Release Manager should:
1. Add NOTICE and DISCLAIMER files
2. Re-cut artifacts with "incubating" in names
3. Review RAT findings and add license headers or exclusions where appropriate
4. Submit RC2 for vote
